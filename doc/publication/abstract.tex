\section{Abstract}
CDAO-Store is a database and set of tools for storing and interacting with comparative data
whose semantics are defined by the Comparative Data Analysis Ontology. The CDAO-store has two
principal objectives. First it seeks to support import and export of data from and to a variety
of data formats in common use, and second it supports online viewing and querying of data.
