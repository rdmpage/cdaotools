\section*{Background}
\subsection*{CDAO}

  CDAO, Comparative Data Analysis Ontology, provides a framework for describing phylogenies and their associated
  character state matrices. It was developed as part of the Evolutionary Informatics working group along with the
  NeXML file format, and the PhyloWS Webservice standard, forming what the group called the EvoIO stack. CDAO forms
  the base of this stack defining the semantics for the data represented as NeXML files, or otherwise supplied by
  services implementing this set of standards. 

  CDAO is defined in terms of an OWL-DL ontology. It provides a general framework
  for talking about the relationships between taxa, characters, states, their matrices, and associated 
  phylogenies. As a general framework it supplies general classes and relations between those classes, 
  it is intended that for practical work these will be extended to for example talk about more specific
  types of characters or states. (e.g. Beak length might be defined as a specialization of CDAO's \textit{Standard} 
  character type). 

\subsection*{NeXML}
  NeXML\footnote{\url{http://www.nexml.org}} is a file format for exchanging data containing character state data
  matrices and phylogenies. It is syntax is defined in terms of an XML schema, and the semantics of its elements
  are defined in terms of CDAO classes. Being defined in this way allows direct translation to CDAO class instances.
  This guarantee is also important to using it as a medium of exchange since it's semantics can be agreed upon by
  both the provider and recipient of a dataset.

\subsection*{PhlyoWS}
  PhyloWS is a standard for exposing phylogenetic data as a webservice, in such a way that particular data items,
  can be referenced by persistent HTTP URI's.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%Implementation %%
%%
\section*{Implementation}

CDAO-store builds on the EvoIO technology stack to provide a framework for supplying semantic services
for phylogenetic data services. The platform is open-source and is available on source-forge, at
\url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdaotools/}. It's divided into three main parts. A data importer/file translator,
a database and web interface, and a gui visualization tool. 

The file importer/translator is implemented in C++ and Python. In addition to its own set of parsers, 
the translator uses the NCL\footnote{\url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/ncl/}} library to read certain file formats.
After reading, it maps data from these files on to an object model that mirrors CDAO classes, and then either converts
to some specified format or to an RDF/XML serialization of the data. The import portion of this part of the system is
written in Python and uses the RDFlib\footnote{\url{http://www.rdflib.net/}} module to store the RDF serializations 
produced by the translator into a database making it available to query on the web or by using the visual tools.

The web and database portion of the application stores, and provides access to the data for the visual tools. This
portion of the application is primarily implemented as a set of scripts in a variety of languages. The web interface
is divided into two principal parts an HTML user interface, and a PhyloWS data provider. The HTML interface allows 
for online querying/exploration of datasets, while the PhyloWS interface supplies access to datasets for our visual
tools or other third party programs. The database portion of the application is implemented as an RDFlib store running
on a MySQL database. 

The visual tools are implemented as a Java JNLP application called CDAO-Explorer. It uses a variety of frameworks
to support its operation including Pellet\footnote{\url{http://pellet.owldl.com/}} and
  Prefuse\footnote{\url{http://prefuse.org/}}. 

CDAO-Explorer provides a tree and matrix search windows which allow one to search for and load particular datasets,
and visualizers for those data sets. It also allows one to make annotations about a dataset, or a general project space,
a set of data sets of interest. These annotations can be from CDAO, Dublin-Core, or from a user-supplied source of
annotation types.

%% Results and Discussion %%
%%
\section*{Results}
 % What should be described here is the functionality of the software together with data on  how its performance and functionality compare with and improve on functionally similar existing software.
  \subsection*{Web-Tools}
  The web tools provide a variety of querying and data access features for both human and programmatic access to
  data. It allows one to retrieve data sets by author name, tree identifier, taxon, algorithm, or method. It also
  supports computing minimum spanning clades, the nearest common ancestor of a set of taxa, or listing trees of 
  various sizes. 
  
  \subsection*{CDAO-Explorer}
  CDAO-Explorer has achieved a basic level of functionality. It provides searching and visualization of both
  tree and matrix data. We believe this integration between tree and matrix viewing to be a novel feature. The
  support for supplementing data with additional user-defined annotations. Additionally, it allows edges to be
  treated as first-class data entities, which can have annotations such as length bootstrap support attached.


%Things to compare functionality with: Nexplorer and PhiloWidget  (about the same functionality with trees, but they dont display matrices and viewing edges as data)

\section*{Discussion}
 % Intended use of the software and the benefits that are envisioned together, if possible, with an outline for the planned future development of new features.

  With this basic level of functionality in place, we envision extending CDAO tools to include support for describing
  workflows in cooperation with the MIAPA\footnote{Minimim Information About a Phylogenetic Analysis} effort.
  We also plan to add additional query features to the web-interface including the ability to process user supplied
  SPARQL Queries.
  
  %Include conversation on MIAPA and OBI?
